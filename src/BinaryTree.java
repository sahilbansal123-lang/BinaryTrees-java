//     Binary trees: are a type of data structure commonly used in computer science and programming. A binary tree
//                   is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child
//                   and the right child. The nodes themselves can contain data, such as a number, string, or object.
//
//                   The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and it is the only node that does not have a parent.
//                   The children of a node can also be nodes that have their own children, creating a hierarchy that can be used
//                   to represent relationships between data.
